# custom _neural_network for binary target.

## Inspiration
A custom neural network is always inspirational.
## What it does
It is a neural net for capable of binary decision like insurance probability. 
## How I built it
I implemented neural networks mathematical formulas with pure python with out any framework.
## Challenges I ran into
the most challenging thing I faced to balance proper coef and bias. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Finally it is giving a pretty high accuracy.
## What I learned
It never can be measured how many things I learned.
## What's next for Custom_neural_network
A more powerful and accurate neural network.
